# OpenAI.el
> Elisp library for the OpenAI API

[![CI](https://github.com/emacs-openai/openai/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/emacs-openai/openai/actions/workflows/test.yml)

The OpenAI Elisp library provides convenient access to the OpenAI API from
applications written in the Elips language. 

## Documentation

- [OpenAI API docs](https://beta.openai.com/docs/introduction)

## ðŸ”¨ Usage

```elisp
(setq openai-key "[YOUR API KEY]")
```

```elisp
(openai-completion "How are you?"
                   (lambda (data)
                     (message "%s" data)))
```

You can also choose which model you want to use by going to the 
[api](https://api.openai.com/v1/models) website and looking at the id's. 
For code usage you probably want something that starts with `code-` whereas 
with more text related files you'll likely want something starting with `text-`.

```elisp
(setq openai-completion-model "NAME-HERE")
```
